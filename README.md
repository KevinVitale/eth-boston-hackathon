# LOGN Marketplace - Buy & Sell Credentials
Allows credentials to real world services to be transferred in a decentralized and trust-less manner through an Ethereum based dApp.

# Inspiration
We identified a number of cases where users may wish to buy or sell access credentials to third-party services, but require a method of exchange via decentralized services.  Examples vary, but could include:

* A gamer who has invested spare time into developing a game character of a high level that would like to exchange it for financial gain

* A citizen of a country with a history of extreme internet censorship who blocks access to VPN sign-up sites and requires purchasing VPN URL/username/password credentials

* A gift recipient who has received a prepaid card/account for a popular video streaming service like Netflix who wishes to sell it for ETH
